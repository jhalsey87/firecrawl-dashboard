# 🕷️ Firecrawl Monitoring Dashboard
> A comprehensive web-based monitoring dashboard for self-hosted Firecrawl instances with enhanced job tracking and real-time monitoring
> This project was forked from the original firecrawl-dashboard to add support for firecrawl v2 apis, add the ability to view scraped data, and apply principles of "Storytelling with Data" by Wiley to the dashbaord design.

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.12+** (required)
- **Running Firecrawl instance** (self-hosted)
- **Access to Firecrawl's Redis instance** (for enhanced queue monitoring)
- **uv** package manager (recommended) or pip

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd firecrawl-dashboard
   ```

2. **Install dependencies using uv (recommended):**
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

3. **Configure your environment:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your Firecrawl settings
   ```

4. **Start the dashboard:**
   ```bash
   # Using the management script (recommended)
   ./dashboard.sh start
   
   # Or using uv directly
   uv run run_dashboard.py
   
   # Or using the CLI entry point
   firecrawl-dashboard
   ```

5. **Access the enhanced dashboard:**
   - **Enhanced Dashboard**: [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000) (with expandable job cards)
   - **Classic Dashboard**: [http://localhost:8000/classic](http://localhost:8000/classic) (original view)

## 🎛️ Dashboard Management

### Easy Management Commands

```bash
# Start the dashboard (finds free port automatically)
./dashboard.sh start

# Stop all dashboard processes safely
./dashboard.sh stop

# Restart cleanly
./dashboard.sh restart

# Check what's running
./dashboard.sh status
```

### Safe Process Management

The dashboard includes intelligent port management:
- ✅ **Automatic Port Detection**: Finds free ports (8000, 8001, 8002, etc.)
- ✅ **Safe Process Cleanup**: Only targets dashboard processes
- ✅ **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper signal handling prevents orphaned processes
- ✅ **Recovery Tools**: Helper scripts for service restoration

### Emergency Cleanup

If you encounter port conflicts:
```bash
# Safe cleanup (only targets dashboard processes)
./scripts/cleanup.sh

# Recovery guidance for other services
./scripts/recovery.sh
```

## ⚙️ Configuration
